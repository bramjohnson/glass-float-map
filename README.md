# Glass Float Project Map
This project is an attempt to visualize the data provided by the Block Island Tourism Council about the Glass Float Project.
It includes features such as viewing information about each float, and filtering by year, location, and area found.

# Why did I create this?
I visit Block Island annually, and my family and I are always looking for floats.
We thought it might be useful to have a tool to view trends and past data about where the floats have been found.

## But really why did I create this?
As a challenge for the Summer, I am attempting to introduce myself to many new tools for programming.
For this project I got a great surface understanding of the following tools:
- Google's API System
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- Node.js and Express
- JavaScript + Functional Programming
- Working with JSON files
